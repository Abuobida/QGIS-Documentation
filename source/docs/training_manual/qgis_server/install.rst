|LS| Install Qgis Server
===============================================================================

A Web Mapping Service (WMS) is a service hosted on a remote server. Similar to
a website, you can access it as long as you have a connection to the server.
Using QGIS, you can load a WMS directly into your existing map.

From the lesson on plugins, you will remember that it's possible to load a new
raster image from Google, for example.  However, this is a once-off
transaction: once you have downloaded the image, it doesn't change. A WMS is
different in that it's a live service that will automatically refresh its view
if you pan or zoom on the map.

**The goal for this lesson:** To use a WMS and understand its limitations.
