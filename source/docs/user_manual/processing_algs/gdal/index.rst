`GDAL <https://www.gdal.org>`_ (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a translator
library for raster and vector geospatial data formats. Algorithms in the Processing
Framework are derived from the `GDAL raster utilities <https://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html>`_
and `GDAL/OGR vector utilities <https://www.gdal.org/ogr_utilities.html>`_ .
