"CRS's are a great source of confusion for QGIS Processing users, so here are"
" some general rules about how they are handled by geoalgorithms when "
"creating a new layer."

msgid ""
"If there are input layers, it will use the CRS of the first layer. This is "
"assumed to be the CRS of all input layers, since they should have the same "
"one. If you use layers with unmatching CRS's, QGIS will warn you about it. "
"Notice that the CRS of input layers is shown along with its name in the "
"parameters dialog."

"If there are no input layer, it will use the project CRS, unless the "
"algorithm contains a specific CRS field (as it happened in the last lesson "
"with the graticule algorithm)"

"Open the project corresponding to this lesson and you will see two layers "
"named 23030 and 4326. They both contain the same points, but in different "
"CRSs (EPSG:23030 and EPSG:4326). They appear in the same place because QGIS "
"is reprojecting on the fly to the project CRS (EPSG:4326), but they are not "
"actually the same layer."

"This algorithm add new columns to the attributes table of a vector layer. "
"The content of the columns depend on the type of geometry of the layer. In "
"the case of points, it adds new columns with the X and Y coordinates of each"
" point."

"In the list of available layers that you will find in the input layer field,"
" you will see each one with its corresponding CRS. That means that, although"
" they appear in the same place in your canvas, they will be treated "
"differently. Select the 4326 layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/crs.rst:49
msgid ""
"The other parameter of the algorithm allows to set how the algorithm uses "
"coordinates to calculate the new value that it will add to the resulting "
"layers. Most algorithms do not have an option like that, and just use the "
"coordinates directly. Select the *Layer CRS* option to just use coordinates "
"as they are. This is how almost all geoalgorithms work."

"You should get a new layer with exactly the same points as the other two "
"layers. If you right click on the name of the layer and open its properties,"
" you will see that it shares the same CRS of the input layer, that is, "
"EPSG:4326. When the layer is loaded into QGIS, you will not be asked to "
"enter the CRS of the layer, since QGIS already knows about it."

"Those coordinate values are given in the layer CRS, since we chose that "
"option. However, even if you choose another option, the output CRS of the "
"layer would have been the same, since the input CRS is used to set the CRS "
"of the output layer. Choosing another option will cause the values to be "
"different, but not the resulting point to change or the CRS of the output "
"layer to be different to the CRS of the input one."

"Now do the same calculation using the other layer. You should find the "
"resulting layer rendered exactly in the same place as the other ones, and it"
" will have the EPSG:23030 CRS, since that was the one of the input layer."

"If you go to its attribute table, you will see values that are different to "
"the ones in the first layer that we created."

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/crs.rst:83

"This is because the original data is different (it uses a different CRS), "
"and those coordinates are taken from it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/crs.rst:86
msgid ""
"What should you learn from this? The main idea behind these examples is that"
" geoalgorithms use the layer as it is in its original data source, and "
"completely ignore the reprojections that QGIS might be doing before "
"rendering. In other words, do not trust what you see in the canvas, but "
"always have in mind that the original data will be used. That is not so "
"important in this case, since we are just using one single layer at a time, "
"but in an algorithm that needs several of them (such as a clip algorithm), "
"layers that appear to match or overlay might be very far one from each "
"other, since they might have different CRSs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/crs.rst:95
msgid ""
"Algorithms performs no reprojection (except in the reprojection algorithm "
"that we will see next), so it is up to you to make sure that layers have "
"matching CRS's."

"An interesting module that deals with CRS's is the reprojection one. It "
"represents a particular case, since it has an input layer (the one to "
"reproject), but it will not use its CRS for the output one."

"Select any of the layers as input, and select EPSG:23029 as the destination "
"CRS. Run the algorithm and you will get a new layer, identical to the input "
"one, but with a different CRS. It will appear on the same region of the "
"canvas, like the other ones, since QGIS will reproject it on the fly, but "
"its original coordinates are different. You can see that by running the "
"*Export/Add geometry columns* algorithm using this new layer as input, and "
