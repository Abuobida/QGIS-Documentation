"The DB Manager Plugin is intended to be the main tool to integrate and "
"manage spatial database formats supported by QGIS (PostGIS, SpatiaLite, "
"GeoPackage, Oracle Spatial, Virtual layers) in one user interface. The "
"|dbManager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can drag"
" layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB Manager, and it will import your "
"layer into your spatial database. You can drag and drop tables between "
"spatial databases and they will get imported."
