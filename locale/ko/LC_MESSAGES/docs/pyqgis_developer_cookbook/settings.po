"문자열이라도 키로 사용할 수 있습니다. 키를 명명할 때 일종의 구조를 부여하는 것이 좋습니다."

"**global settings** --- they are bound to the user at a particular machine. "
"QGIS itself stores a lot of global settings, for example, main window size "
"or default snapping tolerance. Settings are handled using the "
":class:`QgsSettings <qgis.core.QgsSettings>` class, through for example the "
":meth:`setValue() <qgis.core.QgsSettings.setValue>` and :meth:`value() "
"<qgis.core.QgsSettings.value>` methods."

"**project settings** --- vary between different projects and therefore they "

"**map layer settings** --- these settings are related to a particular "
"instance of a map layer with a project. They are *not* connected with "
"underlying data source of a layer, so if you create two map layer instances "
"of one shapefile, they will not share the settings. The settings are stored "
"inside the project file, so if the user opens the project again, the layer-"
"related settings will be there again. The value for a given setting is "
"retrieved using the :meth:`customProperty() "
"<qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.customProperty>` method, and can be set using the "
":meth:`setCustomProperty() <qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.setCustomProperty>` one."
