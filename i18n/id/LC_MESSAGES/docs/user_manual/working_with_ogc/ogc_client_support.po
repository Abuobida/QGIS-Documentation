#~ "WMS servers act upon requests by the client (e.g. QGIS) for a raster map "
#~ "with a given extent, set of layers, symbolization style, and transparency. "
#~ "The WMS server then consults its local data sources, rasterizes the map, and"
#~ " sends it back to the client in a raster format. For QGIS this would "
#~ "typically be JPEG or PNG."

#~ "WMS is generically a REST (Representational State Transfer) service rather "
#~ "than a fully-blown Web Service. As such, you can actually take the URLs "
#~ "generated by QGIS and use them in a web browser to retrieve the same images "
#~ "that QGIS uses internally. This can be useful for troubleshooting, as there "
#~ "are several brands of WMS servers in the market and they all have their own "
#~ "interpretation of the WMS standard."

#~ "QGIS can also act as a WMTS client. WMTS is an OGC standard for distributing"
#~ " tile sets of geospatial data. This is a faster and a more efficient way of "
#~ "distributing data than WMS because with WMTS the tile sets are pre-generated"
#~ " and the client only requests the transmission of the tiles and not their "
#~ "production. A WMS request typically involves both the generation and "
#~ "transmission of the data. A well known example of a non-OGC standard for "
#~ "viewing tiled geospatial data is Google Maps."
