"A polyline is used to show the geometry of **linear features** such as "

"Polygon features are **enclosed areas** like dams, islands, country "

"Now that we have described what vector data is, let's look at how vector "

"vector features into **layers**. Features in a layer have the the same "

"attributes (e.g. information about what species a tree is for a trees "

"the GIS application will only allow you to create new polygons in that "
"layer. Similarly if you want to change the shape of a feature, the "
