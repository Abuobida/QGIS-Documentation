"As we have already mentioned, the processing framework can run algorithms "
"from other applications, but it also contains native algorithms that need no"
" external software to be run. To start exploring the processing framework, "
"we are going to run one of those native algorithms. In particular, we are "
"going to calculate the centroids of set of polygons."

"First, open the QGIS project corresponding to this lesson. It contains just "
"a single layer with two polygons"

"Now go to the text box at the top of the toolbox. That is the search box, "
"and if you type text in it, it will filter the list of algorithms so just "
"those ones contaning the entered text are shown. Type ``centroids`` and you "
"should see something like this."

"The search box is a very practical way of finding the algorithm you are "

"To execute an algorithm, you just have to double-click on its name in the "
"toolbox. When you double-click on the *Centroids* algorithm, you will see "
"the following dialog."

"All algorithms have a similar interface, which basically contains input "
"parameters that you have to fill, and outputs that you have to select where "
"to store. In this case, the only input we have is a vector layer with "
"polygons."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/first_alg.rst:29
msgid ""
"Select the *Polygons* layer as input. The algorithm has a single output, "
"which is the centroids layer. There are two options to define where a data "
"output is saved: enter a filepath or save it to a temporary filename"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/first_alg.rst:31
msgid ""
"In case you want to set a destination and not save the result in a temporary"
" file, the format of the output is defined by the filename extension. To "
"select a format, just select the corresponding file extension (or add it if "
"you are directly typing the filepath instead). If the extension of the "
"filepath you entered does not match any of the supported ones, a default "
"extension (usually ``.dbf`` for tables, ``.tif`` for raster layers and "
"``.shp`` for vector ones) will be appended to the filepath and the file "
"format corresponding to that extension will be used to save the layer or "
"table."

"In all the exercises in this guide, we will be saving results to a temporary"

"Temporary files are deleted once you close QGIS. If you create a project "
"with an output that was saved as a temporary output, QGIS will complain when"
" you try to open back the project later, since that output file will not "

"The output has the same CRS as the input. Geoalgorithms assumes all input "
"layers share the same CRS and do not perform any reprojection. Except in the"
" case of some special algorithms (for instance, reprojection ones), the "
"outputs will also have that same CRS. We will see more about this soon."

"Try yourself saving it using different file formats (use, for instance, "
"``shp`` and ``geojson`` as extensions). Also, if you do not want the layer "
"to be loaded in QGIS after it is generated, you can check off the check box "
"that is found below the output path box."
