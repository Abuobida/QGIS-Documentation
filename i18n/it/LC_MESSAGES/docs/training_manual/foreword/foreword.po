"In 2008 we launched the `Gentle Introduction to GIS "
"<http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/>`_, a "
"completely free, open content resource for people who want to learn about "
"GIS without being overloaded with jargon and new terminology. It was "
"sponsored by the South African government and has been a phenomenal success,"
" with people all over the world writing to us to tell us how they are using "
"the materials to run University Training Courses, teach themselves GIS and "
"so on. The Gentle Introduction is not a software tutorial, but rather aims "
"to be a generic text (although we used QGIS in all examples) for someone "
"learning about GIS. There is also the QGIS manual which provides a detailed "
"functional overview of the QGIS application. However, it is not structured "
"as a tutorial, but rather as a reference guide. At Linfiniti Consulting CC. "
"we frequently run training courses and have realised that a third resource "
"is needed - one that leads the reader sequentially through learning the key "
"aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee format - which prompted us to produce "
"this work."

"This training manual is intended to provide all the materials needed to run "
"a 5 day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is structured "
"with content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users alike and has "
"many exercises complete with annotated answers throughout the text."
