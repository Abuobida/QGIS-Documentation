"GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows "
"anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere in the "
"world. GPS is used as an aid in navigation, for example in airplanes, in "
"boats and by hikers. The GPS receiver uses the signals from the satellites "
"to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) elevation. Most "
"receivers also have the capability to store locations (known as "
"**waypoints**), sequences of locations that make up a planned **route** and "
"a tracklog or **track** of the receiver's movement over time. Waypoints, "
"routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data. QGIS "
"displays waypoints in point layers, while routes and tracks are displayed in"
" linestring layers."

#~ "GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows "
#~ "anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere in the "
#~ "world. It is used as an aid in navigation, for example in airplanes, in "
#~ "boats and by hikers. The GPS receiver uses the signals from the satellites "
#~ "to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) elevation. Most "
#~ "receivers also have the capability to store locations (known as "
#~ "**waypoints**), sequences of locations that make up a planned **route** and "
#~ "a tracklog or **track** of the receivers movement over time. Waypoints, "
#~ "routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data. |qg| "
#~ "displays waypoints in point layers while routes and tracks are displayed in "
#~ "linestring layers."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "There are dozens of different file formats for storing GPS data. The format "
#~ "that |qg| uses is called GPX (GPS eXchange format), which is a standard "
#~ "interchange format that can contain any number of waypoints, routes and "
#~ "tracks in the same file."

#~ "For working with GPS data we provide an example GPX file available in the "

#~ "(latitude/longitude). |qg| expects this and it is the official GPX "
#~ "specification. See http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ "transfer GPS data between your computer and a GPS device. |qg| uses GPSBabel"
#~ " to do these things, so it is recommended that you install it. However, if "
