#~ "However, other additional libraries that you might need have to be "
#~ "explicitly loaded. Just add the necessary commands at the beginning of your "
#~ "script. You also have to make sure that the corresponding packages are "
#~ "installed in the R distribution used by QGIS. The processing framework will "
#~ "not take care of any package installation. If you run a script that requires"
#~ " an uninstalled package, the execution will fail, and SEXTANTE will try to "
#~ "detect which packages are missing, showing you a dialog like the one shown "
