"The DB Manager Plugin is officially part of the QGIS core and is intended to"
" be the main tool to integrate and manage spatial database formats supported"
" by QGIS (PostGIS, SpatiaLite, Geopackage, Oracle Spatial, Virtual layers) "
"in one user interface. The |dbManager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides "
"several features. You can drag layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB "
"Manager, and it will import your layer into your spatial database. You can "
"drag and drop tables between spatial databases and they will get imported."
