"QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3, WFS 1.0.0 and WCS 1 1.1.1 "
"implementation that, in addition, implements advanced cartographic features "
"for thematic mapping. The QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway "
"Interface) application written in C++ that works together with a web server "
"(e.g., Apache, Lighttpd). It has Python plugin support allowing for fast and"
" efficient development and deployment of new features. The original "
"development of QGIS Server was funded by the EU projects Orchestra, Sany and"
" the city of Uster in Switzerland."

"QGIS Server uses QGIS as back end for the GIS logic and for map rendering. "
"Furthermore, the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform-"
"independent C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS "
"Server uses cartographic rules as a configuration language, both for the "
"server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules."
