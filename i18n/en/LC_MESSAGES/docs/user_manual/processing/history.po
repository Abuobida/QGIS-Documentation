" in the history manager. Along with the parameters used, the date and time "
"of the execution are also saved."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for those"
" learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how "
"that same algorithm could be called from the command line."

"Third-party algorithms are usually executed by calling their command-line "
"interfaces, which communicate with the user via the console. Although that "
"console is not shown, a full dump of it is written to the log each time you "
"run one of those algorithms. To avoid cluttering the log with that "
"information, you can disable it for each provider, looking for the "
"corresponding option in the provider entry of the settings dialog."
