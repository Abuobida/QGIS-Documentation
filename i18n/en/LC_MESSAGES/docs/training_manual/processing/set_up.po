msgid ""
"The first thing to do before using the processing framework is to configure "
"it. There is not much to set-up, so this is an easy task."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:10
msgid ""
"Later on we will show how to configure the external applications that are "
"used for extending the list of available algorithms, but for now we are just"
" going to work with the framework itself."

msgid ""
"The processing framework is a core QGIS plugin, which means that, if you are"
" running QGIS 2.0 or later, it should already be installed in your system, "
"since it is included with QGIS. In case it is active, you should see a menu "
"called *Processing* in your menu bar. There you will find an access to all "
"the framework components."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:16
msgid ""
"If you cannot find that menu, you have to enable the plugin by going to the "
"plugin manager and activating it."

msgid ""
"The main element that we are going to work with is the toolbox. Click on the"
" corresponding menu entry and you will see the toolbox docked at the right "
"side of the QGIS window."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:24
msgid ""
"The toolbox contains a list of all the available algorithms, divided in "
"groups. There are two ways of displaying and organizing those algorithms: "
"the *Advanced interface* and the *Simplified interface*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:26
msgid ""
"By default, you will see the simplified mode, which groups algorithms "
"according to the kind of operation they perform. Although some of the "
"algorithms that you will see in the toolbox depend on other external "
"applications (most of them do, in fact), you will not see any mention to "
"those applications. The origin of algorithms is hidden in this mode, which "
"is a facade that simplifies using algorithms through the processing "
"framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:28
msgid ""
"First examples in this guide only use the simplified mode. The advanced mode"
" has some additional features and algorithms, but it requires understanding "
"the applications that are called, so they are a more advanced topic, and "
"will be explained later on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:30
msgid ""
"You can change between the simplified and the advanced interface by using "
"the selector on the bottom part of the toolbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:32
msgid "The toolbox box, when using the advanced mode, looks like this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have reached this point, now you are ready to use geoalgorithms. "
"There is no need to configure anything else by now. We can already run our "
"first algorithm, which we will do in the next lesson."
