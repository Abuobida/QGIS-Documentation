" does not have to enter or select them again next time the plugin is run."

"As you can see, the :func:`writeEntry` method is used for all data types, "
"but several methods exist for reading the setting value back, and the "
"corresponding one has to be selected for each data type."
msgstr "ご覧の通り :func:`writeEntry` メソッドがすべてのデータ型のために使われますが、いくつかのメソッドが後ろに設定値を読み込むために存在し、対応するものは各々のデータ型のために選ばなければなりません。"
