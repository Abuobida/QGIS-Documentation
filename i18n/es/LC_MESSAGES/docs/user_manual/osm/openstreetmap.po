"In recent years, the OpenStreetMap project has gained popularity because in "
"many countries no free geodata such as digital roadmaps are available. The "
"objective of the OSM project is to create a free editable map of the world "

"objective, QGIS provides a plugin that enables its users to work with OSM "

msgstr "Durante los últimos años, el proyecto OpenStreetMap ha ido ganando popularidad, debido a que en muchos países no existen datos espaciales de libre distribución (por ejemplo, mapas digitales de carreteras). El objetivo del proyecto OSM es la creación de un mapa libre y editable de todo el mundo, a partir de datos GPS, imágenes aéreas o conocimiento del entorno por parte de los usuarios. Para lograr este objetivo, QGIS proporciona un plugin que permite a los usuarios trabajar con datos OSM."
