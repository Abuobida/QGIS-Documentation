"Topology describes the relationships between points, lines and polygons that"
" represent the features of a geographic region. With the Topology Checker "
"plugin, you can look over your vector files and check the topology with "
"several topology rules. These rules check with spatial relations whether "
"your features 'Equal', 'Contain', 'Cover', are 'CoveredBy', 'Cross', are "
"'Disjoint', 'Intersect', 'Overlap', 'Touch' or are 'Within' each other. It "
"depends on your individual questions which topology rules you apply to your "
"vector data (e.g., normally you won't accept overshoots in line layers, but "
"if they depict dead-end streets you won't remove them from your vector "
"layer)."
msgstr "A topologia descreve as relações entre pontos, linhas e polígonos que representam elementos de uma região geográfica. Com o módulo Verificador de Topologia pode ver os seus ficheiros vetoriais e verificar a topologia com várias regras topológicas. Estas regras verificam, através de relações espaciais, se qualquer daqueles elementos 'Iguala', 'Contém', 'Abrange', é 'AbrangidoPor', 'Cruza', é 'DijuntoDe', 'Intersecta', se 'SobrepõeA', 'Toca' ou 'EstáContidoEm' outro(s) elemento(s). Das suas questões individuais dependerão as regras topológicas a aplicar aos seus dados vetoriais (ex: normalmente não aceitará ultrapassagens na junção de linhas, mas, se aquelas figurarem becos ou ruas sem saída, então já não irá removê-las da sua camada vetorial).
