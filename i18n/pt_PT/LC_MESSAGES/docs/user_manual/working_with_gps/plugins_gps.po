"GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows "
"anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere in the "
"world. GPS is used as an aid in navigation, for example in airplanes, in "
"boats and by hikers. The GPS receiver uses the signals from the satellites "
"to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) elevation. Most "
"receivers also have the capability to store locations (known as "
"**waypoints**), sequences of locations that make up a planned **route** and "
"a tracklog or **track** of the receiver's movement over time. Waypoints, "
"routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data. QGIS "
"displays waypoints in point layers, while routes and tracks are displayed in"
" linestring layers."

#~ "receivers also have the capability to store locations (known as "
#~ "**waypoints**), sequences of locations that make up a planned **route** and "
#~ "a tracklog or **track** of the receivers movement over time. Waypoints, "
#~ "routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data. |qg| "
#~ "displays waypoints in point layers while routes and tracks are displayed in "

#~ "There are dozens of different file formats for storing GPS data. The format "
