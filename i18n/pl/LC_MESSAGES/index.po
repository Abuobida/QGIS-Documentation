"QGIS is the product of the hard work of many dedicated contributors who have"
" written documentation, translated text, filed bugs, drawn icons, helped "
"other users, built this web site and of course, written lots of C++ and "
"Python code! These contributors have donated their time and energy in order "
"to realise the vision of building a great, free GIS for everyone. We are "
"also the beneficiaries of financial support and sponsored development from "
"many contributors - companies big and small, local and national governments "
"and international agencies who all realise that they can capitalise on the "
"platform we provide and give something back to the project. They provide "
"benefit by making it better for everyone while at the same time reducing the"
" funds they would have otherwise allocated to purchasing expensive "
"proprietary GIS software."
