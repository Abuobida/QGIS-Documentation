"Points, linestrings and polygons that represent a spatial feature are "
"commonly referred to as geometries. In QGIS they are represented with the "
":class:`QgsGeometry` class. All possible geometry types are nicely shown in "

"Sometimes one geometry is actually a collection of simple (single-part) "
"geometries. Such a geometry is called a multi-part geometry. If it contains "
"just one type of simple geometry, we call it multi-point, multi-linestring "
"or multi-polygon. For example, a country consisting of multiple islands can "
"be represented as a multi-polygon."
